# Green-Tech Latvia, 2019
This hackathon, my team and I decided to make a project that could help people in running. By using all the available information from the user and their decided running difficulty, our website would generate a route based on satellite data to get the height and other data like road type from OpenStreetMap. Since we didn't have a lot of time to make this project, even a basic prototype was hard to create, but in the end our team got 3rd place for the idea. After this hackathon our team decided to try to use the prizes and create a business.

## What I learned
This project was simpler than the previous ones. I learned that you don't need a fancy tech stack to make it work, and sometimes it benefits to keep it simple.
## Requirements
This project uses an old leaflet resource, so it does not work anymore. Other than that, you need:

 - [GraphHopperAPI key](https://www.graphhopper.com/) change it in js/main.js
